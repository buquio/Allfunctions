GitHub Profiles are a key piece of "evidence" to an employer that you'd be a good job candidate,
y can see the details of your work. Recruiters use GitHub as a way to find job candidates, 
and many Nanodegree alumni have received work opportunities from their activity on GitHub.
 In addition, using GitHub is a way for you to collaborate on projects with other programmers 
 - this will show that you are able to work well with others on an engineering team on the job.
